        is an American
        singer-songwriter.
        Born in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in Carlisle, Massachusetts, she began posting music on the internet at age
        13.
        <br>
        Clairo rose to prominence following the viral success of the music video for her lo-fi single "Pretty Girl" in
        2017. She subsequently signed a record deal, releasing her debut EP Diary 001 (2018) with Fader Label.
        <br>
        Her debut studio album Immunity (2019) received critical acclaim and spawned the singles "Bags" and "Sofia", the
        latter
        of which became her first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[11] Cottrill's second studio album, Sling,
        was
        released in 2021. Upon its release, the album received critical acclaim and saw commercial success, debuting in
        the
        top 20 of the US Billboard 200.</p>
